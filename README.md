# School District Analysis

## Overview
Using student and school data from 15 high schools, I sought reach conclusions regarding student test score performance (both reading and math), school spending (both overall and per student), and student passing percentage (math, reading, and overall). In completing this analysis, I created several data frames that each organized the performance and spending data differently. I initially executed the analysis with the complete dataset. To experiment and challenge myself, I replaced all the scores of Thomas High School 9th graders with null grades and observed how my results changed. I used python 3.7.6 with Jupyter Notebook along with the Pandas package to perform my analysis.

*	From the above images, itâ€™s apparent that removing the THS ninth grader data had a marginal effect on the overall performance of the entire district
*	Average math score decreased by 0.1 
*	Average reading score stayed the same when rounding to the nearest tenth of a point
*	% Passing Math dropped 0.2 percentage points
*	% Passing Reading dropped 0.1 percentage points
*	% Overall Passing (the percentage of students who scored 70 or above on both math and reading) dropped by 0.3 percentage points

* % Passing Math is 0.09 percentage points lower after removing 9th graders
* Passing Reading is 0.29 percentage points lower after removing 9th graders
* Overall Passing is 0.32 percentage points lower after removing 9th graders
* NOTE: No other rows in the school summary dataframe changed since only data from THS was altered

## Summary of Results

#### 4 Key Changes from dropping THS 9th Graders' Scores

*  Overall passing percentage for the entire school district dropped after removing THS 9th grade scores, which shows that THS 9th graders scored above average overall when considering the entire school district
* Ovrall passing percentage for THS dropped after removing THS 9th grade scores, which shows that THS 9th graders scored above average overall compared to other grade levels at THS
* THS rankes second out of 15 schools in overall performance with and without including their 9th grade test scores
* With slight rounding, average scores organized by school spending, school size, and school type remained the same after removing THS 9th grade scores, which is likely due to the fact that THS 9th graders make up a relatively small portion of the overall school district population
